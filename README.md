# useful_cpp_examples

Small C++ code examples that illustrate a particular concept

This code is mostly educational. I collected them from blog posts, tutorial videos etc. and changed them as I see fit in order to learn things better. Most of them have permissive licence or on public domain, I guess. I don't think I am violating any licence for that matter. But if I do, I would be grateful if you notified me before turning my life into hell.
